# Smart Traffic Management System

## Overview

The **Smart Traffic Management System** is a web-based solution designed to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve the overall transportation experience for commuters. The system leverages advanced algorithms, real-time data, and AI-powered prediction models to assist in traffic flow prediction, demand forecasting, and user reporting.

This project aims to enhance urban mobility and provide actionable insights to local traffic authorities, commuters, and city planners.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Flow Prediction**: Predicts real-time traffic conditions based on historical data and current traffic information.
- **Traffic Demand Forecasting**: Utilizes AI to forecast future traffic demand and congestion patterns based on real-time data.
- **Live Traffic Map**: Provides a real-time traffic map for users to view congestion areas and alternate routes.
- **Issue Reporting**: Allows users to report traffic issues directly through the system.
- **Feedback System**: Collects user feedback to improve system functionality.
- **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Uses geolocation to offer traffic predictions and forecasts based on the user's current location.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Google Maps API**: For real-time location and traffic layer integration.
- **Geolocation API**: To get the user's current location for personalized traffic flow and demand predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the following dependencies:

1. Flask (for the backend)
2. Google Maps API (for traffic data and geolocation)

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-management.git
cd traffic-management
```

### Step 2: Set up the virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Flask application
```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage

1. **Traffic Flow Prediction**: Click on the "Predict Traffic Flow" button to get a traffic prediction for your location.
2. **Traffic Demand Forecasting**: Click on the "Forecast Traffic Demand" button to receive a forecast for traffic demand in your area.
3. **Report Traffic Issues**: Users can submit reports about traffic-related problems through the "Report Traffic Issues" section.
4. **Feedback System**: Users can provide feedback on the system's performance, which helps improve its functionality.
5. **Live Traffic Map**: View a real-time map showing the current traffic conditions using Google Maps.

## API Key

The system uses Google Maps API for location and traffic data. To use the system, you'll need to get an API key from Google and replace the existing key in the HTML/JavaScript code:

```javascript
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=visualization&callback=initMap" async defer></script>
```
